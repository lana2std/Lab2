## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this lab is the Iris dataset.
It contains measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The dataset is commonly used for practicing classification tasks in machine learning.

## Machine Learning Problem
The machine learning problem addressed in this lab is a classification problem.
The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their physical measurements.

This lab focuses on understanding the machine learning workflow rather than model optimization.
